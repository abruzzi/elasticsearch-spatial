# Exercise Data

We need some data for our simple scenario. The datasets can be found in the sample_data directory of the repository. The data we're going to use is information on road crashes as well as suburb boundaries. Both datasets are available for download via the [Victorian (Australia) State Government Data Directory](http://www.data.vic.gov.au/).

In our simple scenario we want to be able to do the following:
+ search for crashes within a particular suburb
+ search for crashes within a distance of a particular point.

The road crash information is a point dataset and the suburb boundary dataset is a polygon dataset.
