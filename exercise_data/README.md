# Exercise Data

The repository contains some sample data which we'll use for the exercise. All the data can be found in: *elasticsearch-spatial/exercise_data*

The directory contains two archives which will be unpacked when the virtual machine is created:

* Melbourne_accident.zip
* Melbourne-Localities.zip

The data we're going to use is information on road accidents and suburb boundaries. Both datasets are available for download via the [Victorian (Australia) State Government Data Directory](http://www.data.vic.gov.au/).

The road accident information is a point dataset and the suburb boundary dataset is a polygon dataset.
