# Requirements

To run this tutorial you'll need to install [virtulbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/).

I also recommend using the [Sense](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sense/doinijnbnggojdlcjifpdckfokbbfpbo?hl=en) extension for Chrome which provides a JSON aware interface to Elasticsearch.

Interactions with the Elasticsearch API are illustrated using [cURL]()

## Grab the repo
